title: A little fellow
---

I saw a poem today hanging in a friend’s office titled “A little fellow follows me” that he received on the birth of his son, it’s message is excellent and I wanted to share it with you. Seeing as I have a daughter, I have adapted it slightly to suit me, though the message is the same. The original can be found [here](https://store.artofmanliness.com/products/a-little-fellow-follows-me-poem-print)

****

>A careful man I want to be,  
>A little fellow follows me;  
>I do not dare to go astray,  
>For fear she’ll go the self-same way.  
>I cannot once escape her eyes,  
>Whate’er she sees me do she tries;  
>Like me she says she’s going to be,  
>The little girl who follows me.  
>She thinks that I am good and fine,  
>Believes in every word of mine;  
>The base in me she must not see,  
>The little girl who follows me.  
>I must remember as I go,  
>Through summer’s sun and winter’s snow;  
>I’m building for the years to be,  
>That little girl who follows me  
>-	Anonymous
